# Responsys Interact REST API python client #

A python library providing access to the Responsys Interact API. Currently supports version 1.3 Release 6.33 E65150-15.

## Install ##

You can install this other ways, but I recommend installing Python3 this way:
http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install3/osx/

This should alias your Python3 and pip to separate commands `python3` and `pip3`.

Then you can clone this repo and install via source package:

    cd responsysrest/
    pip3 install .

## Usage ##

Set your username and password as a dictionary data object in `responsysrest/secret.py`
IMPORTANT: this is ignored by git. If you use another version control you'll need to keep this file out of the way from it!

```
secrets = {
    "user_name" : "MyResponsysInteractAPIuserName",
    "password" : "FillInPasswordHere"
}
```

If you were to need to set these manually you'd do it like this:

```
import responsysrest as r

username = r.secrets["user_name"]
password = r.secrets["password"]
r.login(username, password)
```

In general you should not need to call login from a single user command line session. If you are using this API wrapper to build an application on top of the Interact API then the login function is available to you, but it's still probably not as good as calling the API ad-hoc in order to issue context for the call. The wrapper should manage refreshing context for you.

### Stylized method names

The Responsys documentation (6.33 E65150-15) provides a useful guide to its endpoints but organizes the calls inconveniently and litters the naming conventions with inconsistencies and confusing terms. The wrapper is written with internal/private class names that respoect the documentation, but exposes them as much more friendly and sensible names: `r.get_all_emd_email_campaigns()` becomes `r.campaigns()` or `r.retrieve_a_member_of_a_profile_extension_table_based_on_a_query_attribute()` becomes `r.get_member_of_profile_list_by_id()`

## Specific functions usage:

### Login with username and password

This can be called individually but isn't necessary since any function that requires it will call it.

    r.login(user_name, password)

The login itself returns a context with the Interact supplied endpoint for further requests for that user, an auth token, and a timestamp. Typically this is passed to whatever other request you make each time you do so.

### Retrieving all profile lists for an account

    r.profile_lists()
  
Returns a list of dictionaries of all profile lists. This comes bundled with the folder location and all of the field names too, so to retrieve just a list of the lists, or a list of the lists with their respective folders use

    [list["name"] for list in r.profile_lists()] 
    [(list["name"], list["folderName"]) for list in r.profile_lists()]

### Get all EMD Campaigns

    r.campaigns()

Returns a dictionary of campaigns and their data, along with links and their data.

To see a list of all campaigns or a list of campaigns and their respective folders use:

    [campaign['name'] for campaign in r.campaigns()['campaigns']]
    [(campaign['name'], campaign['folderName']) for campaign in r.campaigns()['campaigns']]

### Retrieve a member of a profile list using RIID

    r.get_member_of_list_by_riid(list_name, riid)

Returns a full record if it's in the list.

### Retrieve a member of a profile list based on query attribute

    r.get_member_of_list_by_id(list_name, record_id, query_attribute, fields_to_return)

Takes four arguments, but requires `list_name` and `record_id`. The list name is that which you want to find the record from in your Responsys Interact instance. The record id is the specific id you wish to use to identify the record. The query attribute is the type of id that you are using to retreive the record. The available options are `r` for RIID, `e` for EMAIL_ADDRESS, `c` for CUSTOMER_ID and `m` for MOBILE_NUMBER. The fields to return is a comma-separated list of the fields in the list, if left blank it will return all the fields.

Examples:

    r.get_member_of_list_by_id('CONTACTS_LIST', 'a@b.c')
    r.get_member_of_list_by_id('AFFILIATES', '901210', 'c', 'email_address_,first_name')

### Delete Profile List Recipients based on RIID

    r.delete_from_profile_list(list_name, riid)

Examples:

    r.delete_from_profile_list('CONTACTS_LIST', 'a@b.c')

### Retrieve all profile extentions of a profile list

    r.get_profile_extensions(list_name)

Returns the profile extension tables (also known as profile extensions, profile extenion lists, or PETs) associated with a given list. This comes bundled with the folder location and all of the field names too, so to retrieve just a list of the lists, or a list of the lists with their respective folders use:

    [list['profileExtension']['objectName'] for list in r.get_profile_extensions(list_name')]
    [(list['profileExtension']['objectName'], list['profileExtension']['folderName']) for list in r.get_profile_extensions(list_name)]

### Retrieve a member of a profile extension table based on RIID

Returns a full record if it's in the profile extension table.

    r.get_member_of_profile_extension_by_riid(list_name, profile_extension_name, riid)

Also takes an optional argument `fields_to_return` which defaults to `all` if not specified. Examples:

    r.get_member_of_profile_extension_by_riid('CONTACTS_LIST', 'CONTACTS_LIST_pet', '101234567890')
    r.get_member_of_profile_extension_by_riid('CONTACTS_LIST', 'CONTACTS_LIST_pet', '101234567890', fields_to_return='FIRST_NAME, LAST_PURCHASE_DATE')

### Retrieve a member of a profile extension table based on a query attribute

    r.get_member_of_profile_extension_by_attribute(list_name, profile_extension_name record_id, query_attribute, fields_to_return)

Takes five arguments, but requires `list_name`, `profile_extension_name` and `record_id`. The list name is that which you want to find the record from in your Responsys Interact instance. The record id is the specific id you wish to use to identify the record. The query attribute is the type of id that you are using to retreive the record. The available options are `r` for RIID, `e` for EMAIL_ADDRESS, `c` for CUSTOMER_ID and `m` for MOBILE_NUMBER. The fields to return is a comma-separated list of the fields in the list, if left blank it will return all the fields.

Examples:

    r.get_member_of_profile_extension_by_attribute('AFFILIATES', '901210', 'c', 'email_address_,first_name')

### Get lists for record

    r.get_lists_for_record(riid)

Loops through every list and checks to see if the record is in the list. If the record is in the list it adds it to the returned object. This is very slow.

### Create a new profile extension table

Creates a new profile extension table. Requires only the list name you wish to extend, but this will create a blank profile extension table using default a folder locations and name.

    r.create_profile_extension(list_name)

Examples:

    r.create_profile_extension('CONTACTS_LIST')

This creates a `CONTACTS_LIST_pet` profile extension table extending `CONTACTS_LIST` in a folder named `___api-generated` with no records and no non-default fields.

You can also specify the extension you want to use, but this function is slightly opinionated and will only let you create a profile extension table that begins with the name of the profile list that is being extended.

This example will create an empty profile extension table extending `CONTACTS_LIST` called `CONTACTS_LIST-Profile_Extension`:

    r.create_profile_extension('CONTACTS_LIST', extension_name='-Profile_Extension')

You can specify the folder to place it in as `___api-generated` isn't particularly likely to suit your needs:

    r.create_profile_extension('CONTACTS_LIST', folder_name='TestFolder')

Additionally you can supply fields as a list:

    r.create_profile_extension('CONTACTS_LIST', fields=['LTV_v1', 'LTV_v2', 'decile'])

If you don't specify a (Responsys Interact) data type for each it will default to `STR4000`. This default data type can be overridden with one of `STR500`, `STR4000`, `INTEGER`, `NUMBER`, or `TIMESTAMP`:

    r.create_profile_extension('CONTACTS_LIST', fields=['last_purchased_date', 'first_purchased_date'], default_field_type='TIMESTAMP')

You can also specify the field type of each within the list if you supply it as a list or tuple:

    r.create_profile_extension('CONTACTS_LIST', fields=[('last_purchased_date','TIMESTAMP'),('lifetime_purchases', 'INTEGER')])

The default field type override can be supplied alongside individual fields without their own field type specifications:

    r.create_profile_extension('CONTACTS_LIST', fields=[('probability_of_login', 'NUMBER'), 'CUSTOMER_ID_', ('ARTICLE_CONTENTS','STR4000')], default_field_type='STR500')
